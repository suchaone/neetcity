figure out the best way to generate the neet graphics

two options:

1. generate the images on the server using something like
   the *canvas* package (canvas graphics api backed by cairo).
   advantages include being able to link to the images for
   easy sharing online, simpler client-side code, no need to
   deal with migrations in case the options or structure
   of the various face/clothing components change, faster initial
   loading speed

2. generate the images on the client. advantage is faster
   loading speed of individual neets once all the assets have
   been loaded

------

the tagline is currently random and meaningless. it should
actually affect the neet's behavior and dialog tree

things like nationalities, ideologies, and occupations should
be objects with various methods

for example, an ideology should have a 'leader' method which 
returns a generic leader tulpa, which itself has some
properties like a name, and the neet's relationship with it

similarly, liking or disliking a thing should be reflected
in behavior (interactions with other neets who like/dislike
the thing) and conversation
